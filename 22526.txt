First day of class - 2/25/26

Joshua Mann - Instructor
Welcome to Unit 1: Blue Team Defense Concepts
Cyber 102

As a community, we will
- be present, physically and mentally
- actively build an inclusive community and space
- practice curiosity and adopt a learning mindset
- ask for help when we need it
- keep our cameras on

Agenda
1. Intro
2. What is a blue team
3. Nist control
4. Lab: it wasn't me - 60 min
5. Wrap up

Joshua Mann will be speaking for 1 hour
3rd generation teacher started working in IT
worked in a NOC - then went to SOC - worked with SIMs - logs into systems
teaching over 5 years IT, cybersec, etc

Saul Lopez Lucas - Managing the team of tech fellows 
Will work in your breakout rooms

They've been through a lot of cyber

Reminder: Classroom Policy
- Attendance at all sessions is mandatory
- All students are allowed up to 2 absences throughout the entire program
  - Students do not need to submit a request to use these absences
  - Students will be marked as late if they arrive after the sessions starts
  - Being significantly late will count as an absence

- All assignments are due at 11:59pm pst the day before the class

Class structure
1 hour of direct instruction and 1 hour for breakout rooms
Direct instruction
- Instructors will present slides
- Students are expected to attend and be present
- Tech fellows will be present and support students by answering questions in the chat or slack

Breakout rooms
- encouraged to work together to complete assignments, activitivies, project or labs

Nearly 300 people in this course

Discussion
NIST defines a red team as a group of people who are authorized to try to attack and break systems

1. What would blue team do? Defense
2. What are possible benefits? Patch vulnerabilities, 

Blue Team - 35 minutes
NIST defines it as - group responsible for defending an enterprise's use of IT by maintaining its security posture against a group of mock attacker - the people who protect the systems

Blue team vs red team
defenders - attackers
network monitoring - pen testing
vul scanning - data and log analysis
risk assess - social engineering
threat detect - threat intell
                custom toolset development

Blue Team Activities
- Analyze current state of security of your org
- Take measures to address flaws and vuls
Digital footprint analysis
DNS audits
Installing and configuring firewalls
Monitoring network activity
Installing and configuring endpoint security software
Using least-privilege access

Now knowing the type of activities they take part in, what type of skills should be possessed by blue team members?
Detail oriented
Psychology
Logical 
Observational
Critical thinking

Blue team skills
Risk assessment
Identify key assests that are most at risk for exploitation so you can prioritize your resources to protect them

Threat intelligence
Stay a step ahead of attackers by knowing what threats are out there so you can plan appropriate defenses

SIEM - IDS - IPS - Week 6

Hardening Techniques 
Recognizing weakenesses in your organization's security is only helpful if you the techniques for fixing them
Monitoring and detections systems
Need to know how to use packet sniffers, SIEM, IDS, IPS

Blue team operations typically occur within a security operations center (SOC)

Security Operations Center
SOC consists of highly trained analysts who work on defending and improving their organiszation's defenses around the clock 
- While not all SOCs are the same, they are usually staffed by:
- SOC analysts
- Network engineer
- Malware analyst
- Other blue team professionals who use enterise and network based monitoring tools

SOC
Monitoring a network of sensors and security tools to proactively identify potential security threats
Analyzing identified anomalies for their severity and potential impact for prioritizng them for remediation
Isolating incidents and implementing controls to prevent future events

Functional Areas of SOC
Discovery -> Primary Investigation -> Triage -> Extended Investigation - Contain, Respond

Real world SOC ops
Wazuh - a siem sol for monitoring detection and alerting of security events and incidents
the hive - a sirp to track security eveents obseved with WAZUH a case management system
cortex- analyze collected observables from security events and helps determine response

sirp = security incident response plan - step 1 identify 

in cyber - just google stuff

Cyber Fusion Center - what is it?
- A next-gen security operations center
- Designed to facilitate collab and communication between teams engaging in related functions such as cyber and IT to reduce risk and improve org's overally security posture
- sec ops colocated alongside crisis response teams, phys sec teams, any number of other incident response teams - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tao4q-_ve_I&t=435s

SOC -> focused on detecting 

NIST control - 10 minutes
ISO in European 

NIST is main one 

NIST cybersecurity framework
- Helps businesses of all sizes better understand, manage and reduce teir cybersec risk and protect their networks and data
- framwork is voluntary
https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final

- it gives biz an outline of best practices to help you decide where to focus your time and money for cybersec prot

NIST system monitoring
external - observation 

System are monirored by observing audit activites in real time or by observing 

One Good thing - 5 minutes

Lab: It wasn't me
Have a mini SOC to solve problem together
